# Mobile simulators

One driver for iOS simulators and Android emulators or devices. The tool
descriptions above carry the contract; `mobile_playbook` returns the full
procedure on demand. Nothing in this body is injected into the prompt.

## The loop

1. `mobile_devices` → `mobile_boot` or `mobile_use` — pick the device once.
2. Get the app on: `xcode_run` (iOS from source), or `mobile_install` +
   `mobile_launch` (a built `.app` or `.apk`). Launch captures logs from the
   first line; `mobile_log` reads them.
3. `mobile_indicator_on` — the user sees a blue frame around the device window
   and "Wolffish is driving iPhone 16 Pro". Seeing and touching tools refuse to
   run until it is up.
4. `mobile_snapshot` → `mobile_tap ref=e7` → read the proof (changed? magnifier
   patch) → `mobile_snapshot` again. `mobile_screenshot` for pixels,
   `mobile_zoom` for small targets, `mobile_wait_for` instead of sleeps.
5. Screenshot the milestone and `send_file` it; `mobile_record` for a flow.
6. `mobile_indicator_off` last.

## Contracts

- **Frame**: coordinates the model gives are always pixels of the latest
  image it received (screenshot, zoom, or the magnifier patch after an
  action). The plugin owns every translation to device points (iOS) or
  pixels (Android). A text-only snapshot with no prior image establishes a
  native frame so refs and coordinates still share one space.
- **Refs**: `e12` handles into one snapshot; they expire after any action or
  60 s. A stale ref is a typed error with the repair call, never a mis-tap.
- **Proof**: every touch returns a change flag (greyscale diff before/after,
  whole screen and near the point) and a 480×300 magnifier patch at 2 px per
  device unit with a crosshair on the exact point; the patch becomes the frame.
- **Indicator**: model-owned lifecycle mirroring computer-use — on first,
  off last; the Agent's guard carries the tail notice, the turn-end nudge and
  the failsafe. A machine that cannot draw it does not lose driving.
- **Errors**: `NO_DEVICE`, `NOT_BOOTED`, `APP_NOT_INSTALLED`, `SNAPSHOT_*`,
  `REF_NOT_FOUND`, `FRAME_MISSING`, `OUT_OF_FRAME`, `WAIT_TIMEOUT`,
  `CHARSET_UNSUPPORTED`, `AXE_UNAVAILABLE`, `INDICATOR_REQUIRED`,
  `UNSUPPORTED` — each with the call that fixes it, `retryable: false`.

## Backends

- iOS: `simctl` for lifecycle, screenshots, video, URLs, pasteboard,
  location, push, privacy, appearance, status bar; **AXe** (pinned 1.8.0,
  managed download into `~/.wfc/bin/axe/`) for the accessibility tree
  and every touch and key. `simctl` has no input injection.
- Android: `adb` for everything — `uiautomator dump` for the tree,
  `input tap|swipe|text|keyevent`, `screencap`, `logcat --pid`,
  `screenrecord`; `emulator -avd` to boot an AVD with a `boot_completed`
  poll. Works on macOS, Windows and Linux.
- The driving indicator locates the device window through a compiled
  CGWindowList helper (macOS, swiftc on first use) with System Events as the
  fallback, user32 on Windows, xdotool on Linux.

## Files

- Screenshots and recordings: `files/screenshots/`.
- App logs and emulator logs: `files/mobile/logs/`.
- Helper-process registry (log streams, emulators, recordings), swept on
  every plugin load: `files/mobile/helpers/`.
