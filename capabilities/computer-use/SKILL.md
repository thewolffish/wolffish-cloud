description: Desktop automation — see the screen and control mouse/keyboard with a verified-aim loop and pointer-free background input. Screenshots and per-window captures, native-resolution zoom, find controls by name through the accessibility tree, clicks that return evidence (delivery, effect, element under the point, screen change), typing, shortcuts, menus, scrolling, drag-and-drop, waits, clipboard, batches — with a shadow cursor so the user keeps their own mouse.

    description: 'Turn ON the screen indicator: a blue glow along the display''s edges, a centered translucent notice telling the user their screen is being captured and controlled, and a SHADOW CURSOR that glides to wherever you act (the user''s own pointer stays theirs). CRITICAL: this MUST be your FIRST action in every computer-use session — before the first capture — and it is enforced, not just asked: every capture and input tool REFUSES to run until the indicator is on and tells you to call this, so forgetting costs a wasted round-trip. It also runs an access check and reports any missing permission with its exact fix (call computer_check_access for the full report). Once on, the indicator follows your actions across displays and stays on until computer_glow_off. It is invisible in screenshots and never blocks clicks.'

Nothing clears the indicator for you and there is no timer: while it is up, the user is being told their screen is still being watched. Ending your turn is finishing — a turn that ends with the indicator still on is handed straight back to you to close it, so the only thing skipping this buys is a wasted round-trip and a user who was lied to in the meantime. On = first action, off = last action, every session, no exceptions.'

Every missing item names what it blocks, the exact settings path or command, and whether a restart is needed. Call it at the start of a session when in doubt, and ALWAYS when a capture or input tool fails with a permission-shaped error — then stop retrying, tell the user the exact fix (use ask_user so they can say when it is done), finish any part of the task that does not need the screen, and continue when they confirm.

    description: 'See a whole display. If the screen indicator is not on yet, call computer_glow_on FIRST — it must precede the first capture of every session, and this tool refuses to run until it does. Captures the chosen display (default 0 = primary) and returns the image plus a Frame line stating its exact pixel size and the aim point (marked with a magenta crosshair). This image becomes the CURRENT FRAME. Every mouse coordinate you give afterwards must be a pixel position read from the current frame, with (0,0) at its top-left — translation to real screen position (display scaling, Retina, monitor offsets) is fully automatic. Screenshot again whenever the screen may have changed; acting on an outdated image is the main cause of wrong clicks. When you know which window you are working in, prefer computer_window_screenshot: it captures that window even when covered and shows less of the user''s screen. If the target is small, crowded, or you are not certain of its exact position, do not guess: find it by name with computer_find, or zoom into it with computer_zoom first. If this tool ever reports that its image was omitted because the active model cannot view images, computer use is impossible — stop and tell the user to switch to a vision-capable model. CAPTURE QUALITY IS YOURS TO SET per capture through max_width and format — there is no user setting for either. Default 1280/jpeg for ordinary navigation; go to 1920-2560 and/or png the moment detail decides the outcome. Neither setting sticks — pass it again on every capture that needs it.'

Pass the region in current-frame pixels; you get back a sharp close-up that becomes the NEW current frame, so you then click using the close-up''s own coordinates. Magnification depends on region size: a NARROW region magnifies a lot, a wide region barely at all — the result states the factor, and if it warns the zoom is weak (under 2x), do not aim at small controls from it: zoom again into the narrower slice it suggests. Recommended flow for any small target: screenshot → locate it roughly → zoom a region around it (for example 300x200) → click its exact pixel in the zoom. Better still, when the app exposes it: computer_find the control by name and computer_click_element it. To act outside the zoomed region, take a fresh capture first.'

# Computer Use — Verified Aim, Background Delivery, Two Grounding Routes

The agent sees and controls the desktop through a closed feedback loop designed for
surgical accuracy with any vision-capable model — and, since v3, without taking the
user's mouse away from them.

## What the model works with

1. **One coordinate space, owned by the plugin.** Every image a tool returns
   (display screenshot, window screenshot, zoom, or magnifier) becomes the *current
   frame*. The model gives coordinates as pixels read off the latest image; the plugin
   does all translation — downscaling, Retina/HiDPI, multi-monitor offsets, and the
   window-local capture pixels the native driver expects. The model never does
   coordinate math.
2. **Two grounding routes.** Pixels (screenshot → zoom → aim → click) and elements
   (`computer_find` by name through the app's accessibility tree → `computer_click_element`
   by token). On every pixel click the element the app reports under the point is echoed
   back, so a wrong aim is caught by one accessibility query instead of by eyesight.
3. **Background delivery through a native driver.** Clicks, keys, scrolls and drags are
   posted to the target *window* (cua's Rust driver, `@trycua/cua-driver`, MIT): the
   user's pointer does not move and the window is not raised. When an app refuses
   background input the driver answers with a code (`background_unavailable`,
   `background_occluded`, `background_uipi_blocked`) and the plugin escalates one rung —
   foreground delivery with the pointer restored — and, only if that is impossible, the
   legacy path that moves the real pointer (nut-js). Every result names the rung that ran.
4. **Evidence on every action.** Delivery rung, the driver's effect verdict
   (`confirmed`, `partial`, `unverifiable`, `suspected noop`, `refused`), whether the real
   pointer moved during a foreground action (the user is using the mouse), the element
   under the point, and an objective before/after pixel-change measurement. The action's
   stated intent (`target`, `expect`) rides the runtime tail into the next step, so the
   model verifies before it plans — one forward pass, no extra call.
5. **A shadow cursor** in the screen indicator: it glides to the point before the input
   is posted and pulses on the press, so the person sees cause before effect while their
   own pointer stays free. `computer_mouse_move` aims the shadow cursor only;
   `computer_hover` is the one tool that moves the real pointer (tooltips, hover menus).

Verified live on Windows 11 too (2026-09-15, build 26200, Electron 39, 35/35 checks;
harness in `src/main/__tests__/computer-use-live/`): background clicks land through an
occluding window, Notepad's UIA tree takes background typing with readback, menus invoke,
the indicator is invisible to captures. Windows differs in three places, all handled: the
driver lists DWM-cloaked shell windows (Start, Search, suspended UWP apps) as on screen,
so they are filtered through Electron's own window enumeration; a posted right or middle
click leaves a Chromium window dropping every later posted click, so those buttons take
the foreground rung there; and Chromium windows refuse background typing and scrolling,
so text and keys take the foreground rung (real input into THAT window, foreground put
back) and scrolling the legacy path with the pointer put back afterwards.

Verified live (2026-09-15, macOS 26.6, Electron 39) against a separate Chromium
process with DOM ground truth: background clicks land on the exact pixel (16px targets
included), double and right clicks, typing and key chords arrive, the real pointer does
not move, the frontmost app does not change, background scroll into Chromium is refused
with a code and escalated, and the content-protected indicator is invisible to the
driver's captures.

## The Small-Target Playbook

For any control smaller than ~20 logical pixels (tab close buttons, checkboxes,
tiny icons):

1. `computer_find` it by name in the window. If it has a frame, `computer_click_element`
   by token — no pixel aim at all. Native apps expose rich trees; web content in browsers
   and Electron apps usually exposes only the window chrome, and the result says so. When
   that web page is in a browser the Wolffish extension is connected to, prefer the `ext_*`
   tools for reading, typing and clicking inside the page, and stay in computer use for the
   browser's chrome, dialogs and file pickers around it.
2. Otherwise `computer_screenshot` (or `computer_window_screenshot`) → `computer_zoom`
   into a **narrow** region around it (2x or more; the tool suggests the size) →
   `computer_mouse_move` onto it (pass `target`) and check that the hairlines pass
   through its **center** and that the element under the point is the one you meant →
   `computer_mouse_click` with no coordinates.
3. Read the evidence line. **No visible change + an expected immediate local effect = it
   did not work**, no matter how plausible the close-up looks; re-aim instead of
   rationalizing. If the effect might be slow, `computer_wait_for` and confirm with a
   capture — and never re-click a send/submit-style control on the report alone.

## Session shape

`computer_glow_on` (first; it also runs the access check) → `computer_list_windows` →
`computer_window_screenshot` + `computer_find` for the app you are driving → act with
`target`/`expect` → read the evidence → `computer_glow_off` (last). `computer_batch`
runs a sequence you are sure of in one call and stops at the first miss.

## Required setup, per operating system

| OS | What must be granted | How the plugin tells you |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | Screen Recording (captures, window trees) and Accessibility (input), attributed to Wolffish.app. Both are one-time; Screen Recording needs a restart. | `computer_check_access` reports each grant with the System Settings path; `computer_glow_on` runs the same check; `request: true` triggers the prompts. |
| **Windows** | Nothing to grant. Windows running as administrator cannot receive input from a non-elevated Wolffish (UIPI) — the driver reports `background_uipi_blocked`. Right and middle clicks, and typing into browsers and Electron apps, use the foreground rung (the window is fronted for an instant, the previous foreground and the pointer put back); the evidence line says so. | Same tool; elevation is reported as a limit, not a blocker. |
| **Linux X11** | Nothing to grant. Write access to `/dev/uinput` (input group or udev rule) enables a second, independent pointer; the AT-SPI bus enables the element route. | Same tool; missing pieces are reported as limits. |
| **Linux Wayland** | Depends on the compositor: GNOME 47+ and KDE 6+ can grant remote-desktop access through the portal; KDE refuses background window input by design. Foreground delivery and display captures work through XWayland or the portal. | Same tool; it names the session type and compositor. |

**Vision is required.** If the active Brain model cannot accept images, the runtime
strips the screenshots and the tools tell the model to stop and ask the user to switch
models.

## Screen indicator (glow, notice, shadow cursor)

While computer use runs, the controlled display shows a blue glow along all four edges,
a translucent pill in the center reading "Wolffish is capturing your screen" (English or
Arabic), and the shadow cursor. The glow breathes, brightens on every capture, and the
cursor pulses on every press.

**Its lifecycle is model-owned.** `computer_glow_on` is the mandatory FIRST action of
every session and `computer_glow_off` the mandatory LAST, whether the task succeeded,
failed, or was abandoned. There is no idle timer. Both halves are enforced:

- **On — a gate** (`indicatorGate`, `plugin/index.mjs`): every capture and input tool
  refuses to run while the indicator is off, naming `computer_glow_on`. A machine that
  cannot draw it opens the gate for that session and tells the model to say so.
- **Presence** (`ensureOverlayAlive`, `plugin/overlay.mjs`): "on" means visibly on. If
  the OS destroyed the window (display unplugged, sleep) while the indicator is on, the
  next gated call recreates it; display topology events rebuild it on a surviving
  display; plugin teardown and app quit take it down.
- **Off — a notice, a nudge, then a failsafe** (`agent/screen-indicator-guard.ts`): the
  runtime tail restates the exit on every iteration (with the last action's intent and
  evidence), a turn ending with the glow up is sent back to close it (twice at most),
  and only when the turn is over on a path where no model step is possible does the
  Agent's `finally` clear it.

The overlay window is content-protected, so it never appears in captures (on Linux it
hides for the instant of a display-scope capture; window-scope captures never include
it), and it is click-through and non-focusable, so input is unaffected. The e2e harness
sets `WOLFFISH_OVERLAY_CAPTURE_VISIBLE=1` to photograph it; production never does.

## Multiple displays

`computer_screenshot` captures display 0 by default; `computer_list_displays` shows
every monitor and window listings carry a display index. Coordinate translation to the
right monitor — including negative origins and mixed DPI — is automatic; there is no
manual offset arithmetic anywhere in the contract. Window-scope actions are per-window
and therefore monitor-agnostic.

## Working with the browser extension

When the window you are driving is a browser the Wolffish extension is connected to
(`browser-extension`, tools `ext_*`), the page itself is not this plugin's job: inside the
page the extension reads the DOM, types and clicks by element with no pointer and no
approval per action, and reads the result back — none of which the pixel route can do
through a browser. **Prefer `ext_*` for everything inside the page and stay here for
everything around it**: the browser's own chrome, native dialogs (file pickers, print,
save, basic-auth and passkey prompts), OS permission sheets, the PDF viewer and other
non-DOM viewers, `chrome://` pages, a browser the extension is not connected to, and how
the page actually looks to the user at their zoom and window size. A task that crosses
the boundary uses both and says so; the glow goes on before the first computer call and
comes off after the last one of the turn, held across the excursion. **Coordinates never
cross**: the extension's CSS-viewport pixels and this plugin's frame pixels are separate
frames — re-ground on the side you are acting on. **Credentials never cross either**:
never type a password, one-time code or payment number the user did not give in this
conversation, on either side — hand the field to the user with `ask_user` and wait.

## Capture quality is model-owned

There is **no user-facing control** for resolution or format. `max_width` (480-2560,
default 1280) and `format` (jpeg/png) are per capture and never persist; zoom and
magnifier images are always native-resolution PNG. A PNG over the per-image byte budget
is **encoded as JPEG at the same width** and the result says so: The width you asked
for is always honored; the codec is what gives. (The API refuses a chat request over
8 MB and the runtime keeps the newest six tool images, which is where the ~1.2 MB
per-image envelope comes from.) Captures are saved under `screenshots/conv-<id>/`
for chat rendering, delivery, and aim forensics.

## Safety

- Clicking, dragging, typing, key presses, scrolling, menus, focusing windows and the
  clipboard are approval-gated (`confirm_patterns`); captures, element reads, waits and
  the access check are read-only.
- The approval card names the resolved target — "Click 'Save' in Notes" — and carries
  the app as its scope, so "Allow for this conversation" allows that app, not a tool
  name.
- Password fields are refused unless the user gave the secret in this conversation.
- Typing text matching sensitive patterns is flagged as destructive; menu items that
  quit, delete or erase are flagged as warnings.
