# Voice

## Interface

- Tools: `voice_generate`, `voice_respond`, `voice_list`
- Engine: **Kokoro** — a local 82M-parameter neural TTS model. Runs entirely
  on-device (CPU) via a managed Python runtime; no cloud, no API key, no account.
- Output: MP3 files stored in the workspace voice directory.

The first voice memo provisions the engine (a hermetic Python runtime, the
kokoro-onnx package, and the ~310 MB model) — this is a one-time download. Every
voice memo after that is fully offline.

You can also provision it up front with `voice_engine_install` — worth doing
when the user asks to set voice up, or when a first memo would otherwise stall
on a several-minute download with no explanation. `voice_settings_get` reports
whether it is already installed.

## When to use each tool

- **The user's message is tagged `<voice_note>` (they spoke instead of typing)** → follow the `<voice_prompts>` block when your prompt carries one — it is present exactly when the Voice replies switch (Preferences page, default ON) is on, and it makes the rule explicit: the turn MUST end with exactly one `voice_respond` speaking the answer — a conversational answer is the memo and nothing else; a working turn delivers files/tables/code exactly as a typed turn would, then closes with the memo. Only an explicit ask in the user's own message ("reply in text") overrides it. No `<voice_prompts>` block in your prompt means the switch is off — reply as normal text.
- **"convert this to a voice memo"**, **"read this aloud"**, **"say this"** → `voice_generate` with the specified text. The voice memo attaches below your text response.
- **"respond in voice"**, **"reply with audio"**, **"voice memo only"** → `voice_respond` with your full response. Do NOT also send the text as a regular message — the voice IS the response. Write only a brief label like "Voice memo" as your text output.
- **"summarize the last response as a voice memo"** → Condense your most recent response into spoken form and use `voice_respond`.
- **"from now on reply with voice memos"** → Use `voice_respond` for all subsequent responses until told otherwise.
- **"list my voice memos"** → `voice_list`.
- **"use a British voice from now on"**, **"talk slower"**, **"what voice are you using?"** →
  the settings tools below. Changing a default is something you do, not
  something you send the user to Settings for.

## Managing the settings for the user

You control this capability's own settings. The user never has to open Settings
to change their voice or speed — asking you IS the way to change it.

- `voice_settings_get` — the current default voice and speed, whether voice
  replies are on, whether the engine is installed, and the full selectable
  catalog. **Read before you write**: it tells you the exact voice ids and speed
  values that are accepted, so you never guess one.
- `voice_settings_set` — writes a new default `voice` and/or `speed`. Pass only
  what changes. The change is immediate and permanent until changed again.
- `voice_engine_install` — provisions the engine on demand.

**How to handle a request:**

| The user says | Do this |
|---|---|
| "use a male British voice" | `voice_settings_get`, pick a matching id (bm_george, bm_lewis, bm_daniel, bm_fable), `voice_settings_set` |
| "you're talking too fast" | `voice_settings_set` with the next speed down (1.25 → 1.0 → 0.75) |
| "speak slower **this time**" | Do NOT change the default — pass `speed` to that one `voice_generate` call |
| "what voice do you use?" | `voice_settings_get` and answer; no write |
| "try a few voices" | `voice_generate` per voice with an explicit `voice` argument; only set a default once they pick |

**Rules for changing a default:**

- A one-off request changes nothing. "Read this in a deeper voice" is a `voice`
  argument on that call; "use a deeper voice from now on" is a settings change.
  When it is genuinely ambiguous, make the one-off call and ask if they want it
  as their default.
- Say what you changed, in words the user recognizes — "Switched your default
  voice to George (English UK, male)" — not the raw id alone.
- Never invent a voice id. If the user names a voice that is not selectable,
  `voice_settings_set` refuses and tells you why; relay that and offer the
  closest match rather than silently substituting one.
- The panel and the user's phone update the moment you write, so do not tell
  the user to restart, reopen Settings, or refresh anything.
- Do not change a default the user did not ask you to change — not as a
  workaround for a failed memo, and not as a "while I was in there" tidy-up.

## Available voices

English only. American (`af_`/`am_`) and British (`bf_`/`bm_`) accents.

| Voice | Language | Gender |
|---|---|---|
| af_bella (default) | English (US) | Female |
| af_heart | English (US) | Female |
| af_nicole | English (US) | Female |
| af_sarah | English (US) | Female |
| am_adam | English (US) | Male |
| am_michael | English (US) | Male |
| am_onyx | English (US) | Male |
| bf_emma | English (UK) | Female |
| bf_isabella | English (UK) | Female |
| bm_george | English (UK) | Male |
| bm_lewis | English (UK) | Male |

These are the voices that can be set as the **default** (via
`voice_settings_set`), and they are exactly what Settings → Text-to-Speech and
the phone's Services screen list. Kokoro ships a handful more that no picker
offers — those still work as an explicit `voice` argument on a single call, but
cannot be made the default, because a value the panel does not recognize gets
rewritten back the next time the user opens Settings.

Leave `voice` unset unless the user explicitly names one for that memo.

## Speed

A multiplier from `0.5` (slow) to `1.5` (fast); `1.0` is normal. Omit to use the
user's configured default.

As the stored **default**, only the four values the panel offers are accepted:
`0.75` (slow), `1.0` (normal), `1.25` (fast), `1.5` (very fast). Any float in
`0.5`–`1.5` still works as a one-off `speed` argument.

## Rules

- Always pass text that reads naturally when spoken. Strip markdown formatting,
  code blocks, and special characters before sending to TTS.
- **Leave `voice` unset by default.** The configured default is applied
  automatically. Only pass `voice` when the user names one for that memo — to
  change what they get every time, use `voice_settings_set` instead.
- For long texts the engine handles them in one pass. No chunking needed.
- Voice files are stored in the workspace and persist across sessions.
