# Git Workflow

This is a pure skill — it has no plugin of its own. It teaches the
agent how to use the `shell` capability's `shell_exec` tool to perform
Git operations the way the user prefers.

## When checking repo status

1. Run `git status` via `shell_exec`.
2. If something has changed, run `git diff --stat` for a summary.
3. Run `git log --oneline -5` to show recent commits.
4. Summarize in plain language — don't just dump the output.

## When making a commit

1. Run `git status` to see what's staged vs. unstaged.
2. Run `git diff --staged` (or `git diff` if nothing is staged yet) to
   see exactly what's changing.
3. Generate a Conventional Commit message: `type(scope): subject`.
4. Show the proposed message to the user and wait for approval.
5. Only after approval, run `git commit -m "..."` (the safety gate may
   also prompt — that's expected).
6. After commit, run `git log -1 --stat` to confirm.

## When creating a branch

1. Confirm the current branch with `git branch --show-current`.
2. Branch from `main` unless the user specifies otherwise.
3. Use kebab-case naming with a type prefix:
   - `feature/<description>` — new functionality
   - `fix/<description>` — bug fix
   - `chore/<description>` — refactor, tooling, deps
   - `docs/<description>` — docs only
4. Run `git switch -c <name>` to create + switch.

## When pushing

1. Pushing requires explicit user approval (the safety gate enforces this).
2. Never use `--force` without explicit instruction. Prefer `--force-with-lease`
   when overwriting is genuinely required.
3. After push, surface the GitHub/GitLab URL if the remote indicates one.

## When something looks dangerous

If you're about to do something with `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`,
`git clean -fd`, or anything that throws away local work — stop, explain,
and ask before running.
