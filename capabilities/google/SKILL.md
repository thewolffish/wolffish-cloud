# Google Workspace

## Before doing anything: confirm the user is configured

Every tool here depends on (a) the `gog` binary being installed and (b) at least one Google account being authorized inside Wolffish. Both are user-facing setup steps that only work from the Settings panel — you cannot fix them from chat.

**Always call `google_accounts` first.** Every other `google_*` tool requires `account` as a parameter — there is no default account. The call fails with a clear error if you omit it. `google_accounts` returns the list of authorized account emails plus surfaces clear setup errors when something is missing:

- `Google Workspace is not installed. Open Wolffish → Settings → Services → Google Workspace and click Install.`
- `No Google account is authorized yet. Open Wolffish → Settings → Services → Google Workspace, upload your OAuth client JSON, and authorize at least one account.`

If you see either of those errors (from `google_accounts` or from any other `google_*` tool), stop the workflow and relay the message to the user **verbatim** — they need to follow the exact path to Settings → Services → Google Workspace. Do not try to work around the missing setup with shell commands; gogcli stores credentials in the OS keyring and only the Settings flow wires it up correctly.

## How it works

All tools use the `gog` CLI (gogcli) under the hood. Every command returns structured JSON. The `gog` binary must be installed and the user must have authenticated at least one Google account via Settings → Services → Google Workspace.

## Account selection (REQUIRED on every call)

Every `google_*` tool except `google_accounts` requires an `account` parameter. **There is no default and no "primary" — pick the email explicitly for every call.** Calls without `account` fail with:

```
Missing required `account` parameter. Call google_accounts to get the list of authorized account emails, then pass one as `account` on this tool.
```

### Identity-agnostic requests: fan out across all accounts

When the user asks something generic that doesn't name a specific identity — "check my email", "any unread mail?", "what's in my inbox", "any new calendar events", "search drive for X" — **iterate over every authorized account autonomously**. Do NOT pick just one, and do NOT ask the user which account to use.

Mandatory flow:

1. Call `google_accounts` to get the full list of authorized accounts.
2. Call the relevant `google_*` tool **once per account**, passing each email as `account`. Run these calls in parallel.
3. Aggregate the results into a single unified response, grouped by account email.

Example — user says "any unread email?":

```
google_accounts → ["alice@gmail.com", "bob@example.com", "work@corp.com"]
google_gmail_search { account: "alice@gmail.com",  query: "is:unread in:inbox" }
google_gmail_search { account: "bob@example.com",  query: "is:unread in:inbox" }
google_gmail_search { account: "work@corp.com",    query: "is:unread in:inbox" }
→ present results grouped by account
```

**Never** tell the user "the tool only supports the primary account" or ask them to switch the primary in Settings — the `account` parameter already handles per-call switching. **Never** ask "which account?" for a generic ask; just fan out. If a single account fails, note it briefly in the unified response and continue with the others.

### Reading counts correctly

Every read/list/search response is wrapped with two top-level fields the LLM **must** trust verbatim when summarizing:

```json
{
  "account": "younes@wolffi.sh",
  "count": 1,
  "threads": [ ... ]
}
```

When summarizing across N parallel calls, **read `count` directly** for each result — do not eyeball `threads.length` or skim the JSON. If `count > 0`, that account has results, full stop. Saying "0 unread" while the response shows `"count": 1` is a hallucination; always quote the `count` you see.

### When to target one account

Only restrict to a single account when the user names one explicitly ("check my work email", "the alice@ account") or when the workflow inherently belongs to one identity (replying in a thread you already read from a specific account). For "my work account" without an email, call `google_accounts` first and ask the user to disambiguate from the actual list.

### Cross-account patterns

- **Identity-agnostic read (the default)** — fan out: one tool call per authorized account, results aggregated.
- **Reply from a different identity** — read a thread on Alice's account, then call `google_gmail_send` with `account: "bob@example.com"` and `thread_id` to reply from Bob.
- **Single named account** — pass `account` for that one call.

## Output format

All tool results are JSON. Parse the output to extract the data you need. Common fields:

- Gmail messages have `id`, `threadId`, `from`, `to`, `subject`, `snippet`, `date`, `body`, `labels`
- Drive files have `id`, `name`, `mimeType`, `size`, `modifiedTime`, `webViewLink`
- Calendar events have `id`, `summary`, `start`, `end`, `location`, `attendees`, `description`
- Contacts have `name`, `email`, `phone`, `organization`
- Tasks have `id`, `title`, `status`, `due`, `notes`
- Sheets data is returned as a 2D array of cell values

## Workflow patterns

### Email workflow
1. `google_accounts` — discover authorized accounts (skip only if the user named one explicitly).
2. `google_gmail_search` — fan out: one call per authorized account, passing `account` each time. For named-account requests, just one call.
3. `google_gmail_read` — read the full thread to understand context (use the same `account` the message came from).
4. `google_gmail_send` — compose and send a reply (use `thread_id` for threading; pass `account` to send from a specific identity).
5. `google_gmail_mark_read` — mark messages as read by IDs (from search results) or by query. Pass the same `account` the messages belong to.

### File management
1. `google_drive_search` or `google_drive_list` — find files
2. `google_drive_download` — download to local filesystem for processing
3. Process locally (read, edit, etc.)
4. `google_drive_upload` — upload the result back to Drive

### Calendar management
1. `google_calendar_events` — check what's already scheduled
2. `google_calendar_create` — create a new event with attendees
3. `google_calendar_update` — reschedule or edit an existing event (pass `calendar_id` = account email for primary calendar)
4. `google_calendar_delete` — delete an event (requires confirmation)

### Task management
1. `google_tasks_list` — list task lists first (no task_list_id)
2. `google_tasks_list` — then list tasks in a specific list
3. `google_tasks_add` — add new tasks
4. `google_tasks_complete` — mark a task done
5. `google_tasks_delete` — delete a task permanently

### Spreadsheet operations
1. `google_sheets_read` — read current data
2. Process or analyze the data
3. `google_sheets_write` — write results back

## Gmail search operators

The `google_gmail_search` query supports all Gmail search operators:
- `from:user@example.com` — sender
- `to:user@example.com` — recipient
- `subject:meeting` — subject line
- `has:attachment` — has attachments
- `is:unread` — unread messages
- `is:starred` — starred messages
- `label:important` — by label
- `after:2026/01/01` — date range
- `before:2026/02/01` — date range
- `filename:pdf` — attachment type
- Combine with spaces (implicit AND) or `OR`

### Default scope: pair `is:unread` with `in:inbox`

When the user asks about "unread emails" without further qualification, default to `is:unread in:inbox` rather than bare `is:unread`. Auto-archived promotional and category-tabbed mail keeps the unread flag indefinitely; users almost always mean *inbox unread*. Drop the `in:inbox` filter only when the user explicitly asks for archived or all mail ("show me all unread including archived", "anything in promotions"). The same logic applies when scanning multiple accounts in parallel — keep the scope consistent across the fan-out so the aggregated count matches what the user expects.

## Important notes

- All operations require the user to have authenticated with Google in Settings
- Gmail send is a destructive action — the safety system will require confirmation
- Drive uploads/downloads resolve paths relative to the workspace root
- Calendar times must be in ISO 8601 format
- Sheets ranges use A1 notation (e.g. "Sheet1!A1:D10")
- The `gog` CLI handles pagination internally for most commands
