# Package Manager

## Usage

Use `pkg_check` first to detect the available package manager. On macOS, if
Homebrew is missing, call `pkg_install_manager` to install it (requires user
approval). On Windows and Linux the system manager is pre-installed.

To install a package, call `pkg_install` with `package_name`. If the package
has a different identifier on a specific platform, pass the override:

- `brew_name` for Homebrew (macOS)
- `winget_id` for winget (Windows) — use the full ID like `Gyan.FFmpeg`
- `apt_name` for apt (Debian/Ubuntu)
- `dnf_name` for dnf (Fedora/RHEL)

When a capability declares a `packages` field in its SKILL.md, the cerebellum
automatically injects the correct platform override so you don't need to know
which OS the user is on.

## Rules

- All installs require user approval through the safety gate.
- Never install packages the user didn't ask for.
- Check if the package is already installed before attempting installation.
- Use the platform-specific override when available for accurate package resolution.
