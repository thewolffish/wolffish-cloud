# GitHub

Interact with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, branches, CI, releases, gists, collaborators, labels, milestones, reviews, notifications, stars, forks, and more.

## Connections

GitHub access is organized into **connections**. Each connection is one GitHub account the user linked, identified by a **label** they chose (for example `Work` or `Personal`). The label is how you — and the user — tell one account apart from another.

- Call `github_connections` to see the configured labels and which account each points to. It never returns tokens.
- Pass the chosen label as the `connection` parameter on every other `github_*` tool call.
- You may omit `connection` only when exactly one connection is configured. When several exist and you don't pass one, the tool returns an error listing the available labels — read it and retry with the right label.
- Match the label to the user's intent: "my work github" → the connection labeled `Work`; "my personal account" → `Personal`. If it is genuinely ambiguous which the user means, ask them before acting.

## Authentication

Set your Personal Access Token (PAT) in Settings > Services > GitHub. The token needs the `repo` scope for full repository access. For public repos only, `public_repo` is sufficient. For gists, add `gist`. For deleting repos, add `delete_repo`. For notifications, add `notifications`. For listing organization membership (`github_list_user_orgs`), add `read:org`.

## When to use each tool

- **Repos**: `github_list_repos` to browse your repos, `github_list_user_orgs` to see which orgs you belong to, `github_list_org_repos` to browse an org's repos, `github_get_repo` for details, `github_create_repo` to create
- **User**: `github_get_authenticated_user` to find out who the token belongs to — useful to resolve "my" repos or as the owner arg
- **Issues**: `github_list_issues` to browse, `github_get_issue` for full detail + comments, `github_create_issue` to file, `github_close_issue` to close
- **Comments**: `github_list_comments_on_issue` for just the discussion thread (lighter than github_get_issue), `github_add_comment` to post a comment
- **Labels**: `github_list_labels` to see available labels, `github_create_label` to add one, `github_add_labels_to_issue` to tag issues/PRs
- **Milestones**: `github_list_milestones` to see project milestones, `github_create_milestone` to add one
- **PRs**: `github_list_prs` to browse, `github_get_pr` for full detail + diff stats, `github_create_pr` to open, `github_update_pr` to edit title/body/state/base, `github_merge_pr` to merge
- **PR reviews**: `github_list_pr_reviews` for review status, `github_request_reviewers` to request reviews
- **PR files**: `github_list_pr_files` for the file-level diff summary (pairs well with github_get_pr for a full review picture)
- **Branches**: `github_list_branches` to see all, `github_delete_branch` to remove merged branches
- **CI**: `github_get_workflow_runs` for run status, `github_get_workflow_run_logs` for failure details, `github_rerun_workflow` to retry, `github_cancel_workflow_run` to stop, `github_dispatch_workflow` to trigger manually
- **Releases**: `github_list_releases` to browse, `github_get_release` for full detail + assets, `github_create_release` to publish
- **Commits**: `github_get_commit` for details on a specific commit, `github_compare_commits` to see the diff between two refs
- **Code**: `github_search_code` to find code across GitHub, `github_get_file_content` to read a specific file
- **Collaborators**: `github_list_collaborators` to see who has access, `github_add_collaborator` to invite, `github_remove_collaborator` to revoke
- **Topics**: `github_list_repo_topics` to see tags, `github_replace_repo_topics` to update them
- **Gists**: `github_list_gists` to browse, `github_create_gist` to share snippets
- **Notifications**: `github_list_notifications` to check what needs attention, `github_mark_notifications_read` to clear
- **Stars**: `github_list_stargazers` to see who starred a repo, `github_star_repo` / `github_unstar_repo` to manage stars
- **Forks**: `github_fork_repo` to fork a repo into your account or an org

## Common tool chains

- **Full PR review**: `github_get_pr` + `github_list_pr_files` + `github_list_pr_reviews` gives you the description, changed files, and review status
- **Before creating a PR**: `github_compare_commits` with base and head to preview what will be in the PR
- **Triage notifications**: `github_list_notifications` to see what's new, then fetch individual issues/PRs as needed
- **Project setup**: `github_create_label` + `github_create_milestone` to set up tracking before filing issues
- **Investigate a CI failure**: `github_get_workflow_runs` to find the run, `github_get_workflow_run_logs` for details, `github_rerun_workflow` to retry

## When to use shell instead

For local git operations (commit, push, pull, diff, log, status, stash, rebase, etc.), use `shell_exec` with git commands. GitHub tools are for the remote API — things you'd do on github.com, not in your terminal.

## Response formatting

Always include actionable links in responses:
- Issues: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`
- PRs: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}`
- Repos: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}`
- Releases: include the release URL from the API response
- Commits: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/commit/{sha}`

## Pagination

`per_page` is accepted by most list tools. The GitHub API hard-caps it at **100** — requesting more than 100 returns a validation error. For large result sets, page through with multiple calls rather than requesting an impossibly large single page.

## Rate limits

GitHub's API allows 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users. The plugin handles rate limiting automatically — if you hit the limit, wait and retry.
