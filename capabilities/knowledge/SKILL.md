# Knowledge — maintain what you believe

Everything you carry long-term is yours to write: **add** a new belief, **amend**
one that has gone stale, **forget** one that is no longer true. These seven tools
are the only way to do any of it without waiting for the nightly pass. Nine
files, one fixed list — nothing else is reachable, and every write keeps a
backup.

## The files

| Target | Holds | In every prompt |
|---|---|---|
| `playbook` | Behavioural lessons: Do / Avoid / User likes / User dislikes / Recipes | yes |
| `instructions` | Standing custom procedures; outrank the core contract | yes |
| `soul` | Your character, voice, manner | yes |
| `user` | The durable profile of who the user is | yes |
| `projects` `people` `preferences` `technical` `decisions` | Curated long-term facts | headings only |

`knowledge_list` prints this live, with sizes and section anchors.

## Which file — the boundary that matters

- A lesson about **how you should behave** → `playbook`. ("Avoid: don't send
  the digest before 07:00.")
- A **fact about the user or the world** → the matching knowledge file.
  ("People → Sana: moved to Riyadh in June.")
- A **standing procedure the user dictates** → `instructions`. ("Always reply
  in Arabic on LinkedIn.")
- Something about **your own manner** → `soul`.

Putting a behaviour rule in a knowledge file makes it invisible to your habits;
putting a fact in the playbook burns the character budget that rides in every
prompt. When unsure: behaviour → playbook, world → knowledge.

## When to reach for these

The trigger is the user telling you to keep, change, or drop something:

- *"Remember I always want invoices as PDF"* → `knowledge_add` to `preferences`.
- *"Sana's birthday is in March"* → `knowledge_add` to `people` under her section.
- *"From now on, always CC Omar"* → `knowledge_add` to `instructions`.
- *"Stop opening every reply with a summary"* → `knowledge_add` to `playbook`
  under `Avoid` — or `knowledge_forget` the `Do` entry that taught it.
- *"That's wrong, she works at X now"* → `knowledge_edit` on `people`.
- *"You keep believing I use Postgres — I moved to SQLite"* → `knowledge_edit`
  on `technical`.
- *"Forget what I said about the 6am digest"* → `knowledge_forget` on `playbook`.

Do it in the same turn they say it. Something you only acknowledge in prose is
gone the moment the conversation ends.

You can also add unprompted, when a turn genuinely teaches you something durable
about the user or their world — that is the same instinct as `memory_save`, just
filed under the right topic. Adding needs no invitation; **removing does**.

## Rules

- **Read before you write.** `knowledge_edit` and `knowledge_forget` need the
  entry copied verbatim, and they refuse an ambiguous match rather than guess
  which belief you meant. Copy from `knowledge_read`, don't retype from memory.
- **Forget beats contradict.** Two entries that disagree is worse than one that
  is missing. When something is no longer true, remove it — don't add a newer
  line beside it.
- **Never delete on your own initiative what the user did not challenge.** These
  tools exist to follow corrections, not to prune what you find inconvenient.
  Pruning by judgement is the nightly deep clean's job.
- **One entry per fact.** If the same belief already exists elsewhere in the
  file, edit that entry instead of adding a second. Re-adding a line you have
  already learned is a no-op, not a duplicate.
- **File it under a topic.** In a knowledge file already organized by `##`
  headings, `knowledge_add` requires a `section` — an entry appended at the end
  reads as belonging to whoever happens to be last, which is how a fact about
  one person ends up filed under another. Pass an existing heading or a new one.
- **Forgetting a `## Heading` forgets the whole topic**, its facts included.
  That is usually what "forget everything about X" means — if you only want one
  fact gone, target that line instead.
- The playbook is capped and rides in every prompt: a write that pushes it over
  the ceiling is refused. Compress or forget something first.
- `soul`, `user`, and `instructions` are the user's own files — they own them,
  you amend them on their instruction. Say what you changed.
- Anything you write here is permanent and re-read every turn. No secrets, keys,
  tokens, or passwords, ever.
- Wrong edit? `knowledge_restore` swaps the file back. Restoring again swaps
  forward, so it is always safe to try.

## What you still cannot edit

`agents.core.md` (the core contract) and the workflow role files are rewritten
by the app on every launch — editing them is pointless, so they are not in the
list. The nightly reflection day-files and `reviewed.json` are the raw audit
trail: rewriting history is not the same as amending a belief. To read any of
them, use `memory_get` or `file_read`.
