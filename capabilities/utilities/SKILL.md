description: Small built-in utility tools that don't belong to a bigger capability — delivering files to the user as attachments, and pushing openable folder/file location cards.

  - attachment
  - deliver file
  - share file
  - upload file
  - here is the file
  - here's the file
  - open folder
  - open the folder
  - reveal in finder
  - show in finder
  - show the folder
tools:
  - name: send_file
    description: "Deliver a file to the user as a downloadable attachment in the conversation they are talking to you in — it renders in the in-app chat and the CLI, and is uploaded/sent natively on WhatsApp and Telegram. Works for ANY file type (documents, images, audio, video, archives, code, text, etc.). THIS IS THE ONLY WAY A FILE REACHES THE USER: no tool auto-delivers its output, so every file you create, convert, edit, or download for the user MUST be sent with this call once the work is done. Never end a task by just naming a saved path. No size limit in-app or in the CLI; WhatsApp and Telegram refuse files over their own upload ceilings and tell the user where the file is. Pass the file path — absolute, ~/-relative, or workspace-relative."
    parameters:
      file:
        type: string
        description: "Path to the file to deliver. Absolute (/Users/you/report.pdf), home-relative (~/Desktop/report.pdf), or workspace-relative (files/report.pdf)."
        required: true
  - name: show_path
    description: "Push an openable location card for a folder or file on disk into the in-app chat: a folder gets an Open button (opens it in the OS file manager), a file gets a Reveal button (opens its folder with the file selected, like Reveal in Finder). Use it whenever the user would want to jump to a location — a folder you created or organized, a batch of outputs, a file deliberately left in place instead of sent. The path must exist. In-app desktop chat only — on WhatsApp/Telegram nothing renders, so name the path in prose there instead."
    parameters:
      path:
        type: string
        description: "Folder or file to show. Absolute (/Users/you/Projects), home-relative (~/Downloads), or workspace-relative (files/)."

# Utilities

A grab-bag of small, always-available helpers that are too small to each be
their own capability. Add new general-purpose utility tools here rather than
spinning up a new capability for every one-off.

## `send_file` — deliver a file to the user

Use `send_file` to actually hand a file to the user inside the conversation. Saving a
file to disk and telling the user "saved to …/files/report.pdf" is **not** delivery —
on WhatsApp and Telegram the user never sees the file, and even in the app the path is
not the file. `send_file` closes that gap on every channel at once.

### When to call it — the default, every time

Call `send_file` for **any** file you created, edited, converted, downloaded, or saved — a
Python/PIL image edit, an ImageMagick call, a shell/script output, a download, a file saved
outside the workspace (the Desktop, etc.), a pre-existing file the user asked for. Deliver it as
the last real step, then write your short wrap-up. A file the user can't see is a failed task —
**when in doubt, send it.**

**Re-deliver every version when the user is iterating.** If they're refining a file — you edit,
regenerate, "make it red", "now orange" — call `send_file` on the **updated** file each time,
even if you delivered a file at that same path in an earlier turn. Each new version is a new
result the user must see. A new turn, a different file, or an edited version always gets sent.

**Chart cards.** A file whose name ends in `.chart.json` is a chart spec: `send_file` delivers
it as an interactive chart card in the in-app chat (on WhatsApp/Telegram it arrives as a plain
document, so prefer a text table there). The spec format and when to chart live in the core
`dataviz` tool's manual — call `dataviz` before authoring one.

### When NOT to call it — almost never

NOTHING auto-attaches anymore: no generation tool (pdf, browser_pdf, ffmpeg, image/meme
generation, shell `open`) delivers its own output. If you don't call `send_file`, the user
receives nothing — on every channel. The only reasons to skip it: (1) you already sent this
exact file this turn (the runtime status lists your sends), or (2) the user explicitly asked
for the file to be placed somewhere without delivery — and if you're merely unsure, ASK
whether they want it sent rather than silently withholding it.

### Notes

- Pass any path: absolute, `~/`-relative, or workspace-relative. Files outside the
  workspace are copied into `files/` automatically so the in-app viewer can load them.
- No size limit in the in-app chat or the CLI — both read the file straight off local disk.
  WhatsApp and Telegram enforce their own upload ceilings: an oversized video is re-encoded
  to fit, anything else is refused with its path so you can tell the user where it lives.

## `show_path` — push an openable location card

`show_path` renders a card in the in-app chat with the folder/file name, its path, and a
button: **Open** for a folder (opens it in the OS file manager) or **Reveal** for a file
(opens its parent folder with the file selected). Nothing is parsed from your prose —
this card exists ONLY when you call the tool, so call it whenever the user would want to
jump to a location:

- You created or organized a **folder** (a project scaffold, a sorted Downloads, a batch
  of outputs) — folders can't be attached with `send_file`, so this card IS their delivery.
- You placed a file at a user-named spot instead of sending it, or a file is too large for
  `send_file` — show where it lives.

The path must exist — the call fails on a typo or a not-yet-created path. **In-app desktop
chat only**: on WhatsApp/Telegram the card doesn't render (there's no desktop to open), so
name the path in prose there instead. `show_path` complements `send_file`, never replaces
it — a deliverable FILE still gets `send_file`.
