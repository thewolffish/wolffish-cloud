// Utilities — small, always-available helper tools that are too small to
// each warrant their own capability. Add new general-purpose tools here:
// register them in toolDefinitions, handle them in execute(), and (if they
// take a notable argument) describe them in describeAction().
//
// Tools:
//   - send_file: deliver a file to the user as a native attachment on
//     whatever channel they're on (in-app, the terminal, the phone).
//   - show_path: push an openable location card for a folder/file on disk
//     into the in-app chat (folder → Open, file → Reveal in folder).
//   - wait: block this turn for as long as the model asks, behind a card
//     that says why and lets the user cut it short.

// No size ceiling here on purpose. This tool is CHANNEL-BLIND — it emits a
// marker and the surface the user is actually on decides what to do with it —
// so a bot API's 50 MB upload limit does not belong at this layer: it made the
// in-app chat and the CLI, which upload nothing and read the file straight off
// local disk, refuse files they could have delivered instantly. A remote
// surface enforces its own limits at the point of upload, which is the only
// place the limit is real.

// Type buckets mirror the channel + renderer extractors so the
// `[wolffish-output: <path> (<type>)]` marker we emit is recognized and
// delivered everywhere. Anything not in these sets is delivered as a
// generic `(file)` (rendered as a file card / sent as a document).
// One suffix-based type rides above the buckets: `*.chart.json` → `(chart)`,
// the interactive chart-card spec (see the dataviz capability) — the in-app
// renderer draws it as a live chart; channels fall back to a document send.
