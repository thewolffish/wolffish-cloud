# Notion

## Connections

Notion access is organized into **connections**. Each connection is one Notion workspace the user linked, identified by a **label** they chose (for example `Personal` or `Wolffish`). The label is how you — and the user — tell one workspace apart from another.

- Call `notion_connections` to see the configured labels and which account each points to. It never returns tokens.
- Pass the chosen label as the `connection` parameter on every other `notion_*` tool call.
- You may omit `connection` only when exactly one connection is configured. When several exist and you don't pass one, the tool returns an error listing the available labels — read it and retry with the right label.
- Match the label to the user's intent: "my personal notion" → the connection labeled `Personal`; "the Wolffish workspace" → `Wolffish`. If it is genuinely ambiguous which the user means, ask them before acting.

## Content model

Notion's API uses a block-based content model:

- **Pages** are the primary unit. A page has **properties** (metadata like title, status, dates, people, relations) and a **body** made of **blocks**.
- **Databases** are collections of pages. Each page in a database has properties matching the database schema (columns). Databases can be queried with filters and sorts.
- **Blocks** are content elements: paragraphs, headings, lists, to-dos, code, images, embeds, toggles, callouts, tables, columns, and more. Blocks can have **children** (nested blocks).

## How properties work

Properties are key-value pairs on a page. The key is the property name, the value is a typed object:

- `title` — the page name: `{ "title": [{ "text": { "content": "My Page" } }] }`
- `rich_text` — text field: `{ "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "some text" } }] }`
- `number` — `{ "number": 42 }`
- `select` — `{ "select": { "name": "Option A" } }`
- `multi_select` — `{ "multi_select": [{ "name": "Tag1" }, { "name": "Tag2" }] }`
- `date` — `{ "date": { "start": "2024-01-15", "end": "2024-01-20" } }`
- `checkbox` �� `{ "checkbox": true }`
- `url` — `{ "url": "https://example.com" }`
- `email` — `{ "email": "user@example.com" }`
- `phone_number` — `{ "phone_number": "+1234567890" }`
- `people` — `{ "people": [{ "id": "user-uuid" }] }`
- `relation` — `{ "relation": [{ "id": "page-uuid" }] }`
- `status` — `{ "status": { "name": "In Progress" } }`
- `formula`, `rollup`, `created_time`, `last_edited_time`, `created_by`, `last_edited_by` — read-only computed properties

## How blocks work

Each block has a `type` field and a corresponding content object. Common block types:

```
paragraph:     { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Hello" } }] }
heading_1:     { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Title" } }] }
heading_2:     { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Subtitle" } }] }
heading_3:     { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Section" } }] }
bulleted_list_item: { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Item" } }] }
numbered_list_item: { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Item" } }] }
to_do:         { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Task" } }], "checked": false }
toggle:        { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Toggle title" } }] }
code:          { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "const x = 1" } }], "language": "javascript" }
quote:         { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Quote text" } }] }
callout:       { "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Important!" } }], "icon": { "emoji": "⚠️" } }
divider:       {}
table_of_contents: {}
image:         { "external": { "url": "https://..." } }
bookmark:      { "url": "https://..." }
equation:      { "expression": "E = mc^2" }
```

When creating blocks, wrap the content under `{ "type": "<block_type>", "<block_type>": { ... } }`:

```json
{
  "type": "paragraph",
  "paragraph": {
    "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Hello world" } }]

## Rich text

Rich text is an array of text objects with optional annotations:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": { "content": "Bold text", "link": null },
    "annotations": { "bold": true, "italic": false, "strikethrough": false, "underline": false, "code": false, "color": "default" }
  },
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": { "content": " and normal text" }
  }
]
```

Annotations are optional — omit them for plain text. Available colors: `default`, `gray`, `brown`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, `red`, and background variants like `gray_background`.

## Database filters

Filters are nested objects. Simple filter:
```json
{ "property": "Status", "status": { "equals": "Done" } }
```

Compound filter:
```json
{
  "and": [
    { "property": "Status", "status": { "equals": "In Progress" } },
    { "property": "Priority", "select": { "equals": "High" } }
  ]
}
```

Filter operators vary by property type:
- text/rich_text: `equals`, `does_not_equal`, `contains`, `does_not_contain`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
- number: `equals`, `does_not_equal`, `greater_than`, `less_than`, `greater_than_or_equal_to`, `less_than_or_equal_to`
- checkbox: `equals`, `does_not_equal`
- select: `equals`, `does_not_equal`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
- multi_select: `contains`, `does_not_contain`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
- date: `equals`, `before`, `after`, `on_or_before`, `on_or_after`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`, `past_week`, `past_month`, `past_year`, `next_week`, `next_month`, `next_year`
- status: `equals`, `does_not_equal`
- people: `contains`, `does_not_contain`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
- relation: `contains`, `does_not_contain`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`

## Database sorts

```json
[
  { "property": "Created", "direction": "descending" },
  { "property": "Name", "direction": "ascending" }
]
```

Or sort by timestamp: `{ "timestamp": "last_edited_time", "direction": "descending" }`

## IDs

Notion IDs are UUIDs. They can be formatted with or without dashes:
- `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc`
- `123456781234123412341234567890abc`

Both formats are accepted in all tools. You can extract page IDs from Notion URLs — the 32-character hex string after the last dash in the URL path.

## Pagination

List and query endpoints return `has_more` and `next_cursor`. When `has_more` is true, pass `next_cursor` as `start_cursor` in the next call to get the next page of results.

## Workflow patterns

### Read a page fully
1. `notion_read_page` — get properties (title, metadata)
2. `notion_read_blocks` — get the page body (content blocks)
3. For deeply nested content, call `notion_read_blocks` again with child block IDs

### Reading an ID that turns out to be a database
Notion page IDs and database IDs are indistinguishable UUIDs, so you often can't tell which kind an ID is up front.
- To read a **database's schema/columns** (or an empty database), use `notion_get_database`.
- To **query a database's rows**, use `notion_read_database`.
- If you call `notion_read_page` on an ID that is actually a database, it self-heals: it detects the case and returns the database object instead (look at the `object` field — `"page"` vs `"database"`). `notion_get_database` self-heals symmetrically for a page ID.

### Escape hatch — `notion_api`
`notion_api` makes a raw request to any Notion REST endpoint. Reach for it only when no dedicated `notion_*` tool covers what you need — for example a single block (`GET "blocks/{id}"`), a paginated page property with more than 25 relation/rollup values (`GET "pages/{id}/properties/{prop_id}"`), or a newer-API surface such as data sources (pass `notion_version: "2025-09-03"`). Prefer the dedicated tools when they exist — they are simpler, cheaper, and safer. Errors come back in the same `Notion API error (<code>): <message>` form as the other tools, so you can self-correct the same way.

### Add content to a page
1. Build block objects for the content
2. `notion_append_blocks`, passing the destination page (or block) ID as `block_id` and the block objects as `children`. `block_id` is required on every call — omitting it fails the append; there is no implicit "current page."
3. Building a large page in several appends? Keep each append well under the 2000-block limit, and after the final append read the page back with `notion_read_blocks` to confirm every planned section actually landed before telling the user it's done.

### Create a database entry
1. Use `notion_get_database` to read the schema (the columns and their types). `notion_read_database` returns rows, not the column schema — and returns nothing for an empty database.
2. Build properties matching the database columns
3. `notion_create_page` with `parent: { "database_id": "..." }`

### Creating several pages at once
Every `notion_create_page` needs its own `parent` — there is no implicit "current page," so omitting `parent` fails with `parent is required`. To create N pages in the same database (or under the same page), first obtain the destination id **once** (via `notion_search` or `notion_get_database`), then make N calls that each pass that same `parent: { "database_id": "<id>" }`. Don't fire off creates before you have a real parent id; resolve it first, then fan out.

### Update a database entry
1. `notion_update_page` with the page ID and updated properties

### Archive / soft-delete
- Pages: `notion_update_page` with `archived: true`
- Blocks: `notion_delete_block` or `notion_update_block` with `archived: true`

## Limitations

- The integration can only access pages and databases explicitly shared with it
- Rate limit: ~3 requests/second sustained
- Block content max: 2000 blocks per append
- Rich text max: 2000 characters per text block
- Cannot upload files — use external URLs for images and file blocks
- Cannot change page parent after creation
- Cannot reorder blocks — only append new ones
