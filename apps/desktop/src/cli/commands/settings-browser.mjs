 *
 * The hierarchy is not decoration. Labels in this app are CARD-SCOPED — inside
 * a Telegram card, a row called "Status" or "Verbose task results" is
 * unambiguous, and four channels legitimately carry the same two words. Print
 * them as one flat list and the result is what this replaced: fifty-six rows
 * with "Verbose task results" appearing four times and no way to tell which
 * one is WhatsApp's. Grouping is the disambiguation, and it is also how
 * someone who knows where a setting lives on screen finds it here.
 *
 * Blank always goes UP one level (and out at the top), so there is one key to
