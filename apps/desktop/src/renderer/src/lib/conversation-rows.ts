 * chat writes an 'Untitled' shell that still reaches the cortex a beat behind
 * the turn. Without it the row only shows up once the work is over.
 *
 * ALL phases are synthesized, not just 'processing': gating on processing made
 * a conversation VANISH the instant it completed — its phase flipped
 * synchronously while the list refetch was still in flight, so it fell out of
 * both sources for a render and the whole list reflowed. Once the index has
 * it, the indexed row wins, so a synthesized row is only ever a brief bridge.
