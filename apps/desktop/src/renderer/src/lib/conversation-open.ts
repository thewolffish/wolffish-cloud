/**
 * Bring an open feed up to date with the conversation file another surface

 *
 *  - APPEND what the feed has never seen (the disk messages whose ids it
 *    doesn't hold), which is how a reply typed elsewhere lands in a chat
 *    sitting open on screen.
 *  - REFRESH what the feed holds a STALE copy of. A run on another surface
 *    streams its assistant message into this feed as throttled snapshots
 *    under the id it will be saved with, and the last snapshot always stops
 *    short of the finished answer — a reply that finishes inside the throttle
 *    window leaves the feed on the FIRST snapshot, often segments-only (a
 *    model chip), which draws as an empty bubble. Append-only then discarded
 *    the fold's complete copy for carrying an id the feed already knew, so
 *    the prompt sat under a blank answer until the app was restarted (closing
 *    the window only hides it — the feed survives).
 *
 * Returns `prev` itself when nothing changed, so React bails out and nothing
 * re-renders: the broadcast behind this carries no conversation id, so it
 * fires for every conversation's writes and most calls are no-ops.
 *
 * `isPersisted` is the caller's own feed→file projection (Chat's
 * isPersistedMessage) rather than a copy of it: this has to count what the
 * feed holds exactly the way the writer counts it, and a second definition
 * that drifted would mis-index the transcript.
