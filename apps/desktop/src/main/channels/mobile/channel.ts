/**
 * The Mobile channel — the desktop end of the tunnel to wolffish-mobile.
 *
 * Structurally a sibling of the Telegram and WhatsApp channels: it owns a
 * transport, exposes status to the settings panel, and serves the agent's
 * world to a remote surface. What differs is the shape of that surface. A
 * Telegram chat is a message stream; the phone is a second view of the whole
 * app, so this channel answers for configuration, the conversation index,
 * conversation bodies on demand, and usage — and pushes changes as they
 * happen so the phone stays live rather than polling.
 *
 * The desktop is the `host`: it parks on the relay and waits. The phone dials
 * in when it is in the foreground and disappears when iOS suspends it, which
 * is why every reconnect re-handshakes and nothing here assumes continuity.

   *
   * Every full snapshot that passes through here is also CACHED as the
   * conversation's turn-so-far, connected phone or not — Rpc.turnMirror
   * serves it to a phone that joins or rejoins mid-turn, which is the one
   * moment nothing else can redraw the run.
   *
   * `userMessage` — the prompt this turn is answering — travels on BOTH paths.
   * It is a couple of hundred bytes and it is the half of the exchange the
   * phone cannot get anywhere else while the turn runs, so it must not be
   * dropped along with an assistant snapshot that needed trimming: those are
   * exactly the long turns where the gap is most visible.
