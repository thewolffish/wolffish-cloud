 *           fall back, an undeliverable link is refused with the real list.
 *   REPORT  what actually happened, including when that is "unknown". A
 *           delivery the relay never confirmed is said to be UNCONFIRMED
 *           rather than failed, because the two call for different judgements
 *           and only the model gets to make them.
 *
 * The one hard rule points at the harness, not the model: one call, one frame.

It lands even when the mobile app is closed or backgrounded, and when the phone is offline it arrives as soon as signal returns (iOS and Android alike), so this reaches the user when nothing else does. This tool being available already means a phone is paired and notifications are allowed. NOTIFYING IS THE DEFAULT — silence is what needs a reason. END EVERY TURN WITH ONE CALL: after the work is done and any files are delivered, as the closing beat of the turn — phase 'completed' (or 'failed'), deeplink "${DEEPLINK_SCHEME}chat?id=${CURRENT_CONVERSATION}". A turn the user watched you finish still gets one; they will be somewhere else five minutes from now, and the phone is a second surface, not a mirror of the screen they happen to be at. Send one MID-turn too, without waiting for the end, the moment something major happens: you are blocked on their input or approval ('needs_input' — the moment you block; it expires in minutes), a step fails in a way that changes the plan, or you turn up a finding they would act on now rather than in ten minutes. Long work (a big build, scrape, render, video, multi-step automation) also earns a 'started' so they know it is underway, and a scheduled automation always closes its digest with one 'completed'. The BODY must carry real information — the outcome, the number, what is next: 'AI news is ready — 7 stories, 2 worth your time' or 'Sheet rebuilt — 214 rows, 3 broken dates fixed' earn the buzz; 'Task completed' and 'Done' waste it. Stay silent only when there is genuinely nothing to carry (small talk, a one-line acknowledgment, an answer the notification would repeat word for word), for mid-turn narration ('opened the file', 'tests running' — prose does that job), on Telegram/WhatsApp turns where your reply already reached that same phone as a message with its own notification (there, notify only for the blocker/failure/major-finding cases), or when the user has asked for quiet. A notification COMPLEMENTS your conversation reply, never replaces any part of it: it is not shown in the conversation, so the reply must stand complete on its own and never lean on the notification. NEVER THE SAME NEWS TWICE — nothing here counts your notifications or refuses a repeat, so every call lands on the user's phone: one call per moment, never a reworded repeat, and never a retry loop. An answer reporting delivery as UNCONFIRMED means it may already be on their lock screen, so sending it again — reworded, re-phased, or verbatim — is how one notification becomes three in someone's pocket.`,
