/**
 * Builds the config snapshot the phone renders.
 *
 * The shape is `ConfigSnapshot` in wolffish-mobile (`src/state/demoConfig.ts`)
 * — the exact object demo mode already ingests. Serving the same shape live is
 * what lets every settings screen on the phone work in paired mode without a
 * single change: the phone calls `applySnapshot()` either way and cannot tell
 * a downloaded demo bundle from a live desktop.
 *
 * Every optional field in that contract is genuinely optional ("absent in
 * bundles published before X shipped"), so a section this builder cannot
 * resolve is omitted rather than faked, and the phone falls back to its
 * documented default instead of rendering an invented number.
 *
 * The reference artifact for the contract is the committed demo snapshot
 * (wolffish-mobile/demo-data/config-snapshot.json): every key below exists
 * there in the same shape. Field names come from WorkspaceConfig
 * (workspace/workspace.ts) — the real ones, not paraphrases: `defaultVoice`
 * not `voice`, `allowedPhoneNumbers` not `allowedNumbers`,
 * `hideAutomationsFromResume` not `hideAutomations`. Getting one wrong does
 * not error anywhere; it renders a silent default on the phone forever.
