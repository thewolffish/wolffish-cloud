/**
 * Fitting a live mirror snapshot inside a wire budget.
 *
 * The tunnel's relay closes a connection on any record over 1 MiB, so every
 * mirrored message travels under a hard ceiling (MIRROR_MAX_BYTES in the
 * mobile channel). The first shape of that guard simply WITHHELD an oversized
 * snapshot — and that silence is how a long tool-heavy turn went dark on the
 * phone for its whole remaining runtime (2026-08-22: twelve minutes of a
 * Gmail sweep invisible, and a phone relaunched mid-turn came back to a blank
 * conversation, because the only pipe that could have redrawn it was the one
 * being withheld).
 *
 * So: never withhold — TRIM. The bulk of a big snapshot is never the prose
 * the user is reading; it is tool payloads (a gmail_search dump, a heredoc
 * command) that the phone renders as collapsed cards anyway. Shorten those,
 * oldest first, keep the newest segments whole — the live edge is what the
 * user is actually watching — and the persisted transcript restores every
 * byte when the turn folds, because the fold saves the accumulator, not the
 * trimmed copy.
 *
 * Everything here is PURE: the accumulator's segments are the very objects
 * the end-of-turn save persists, so nothing in this module may mutate its
 * input. Copies are made only where something is actually shortened.
 */

 * Appended wherever the phone's copy shortens a string it is showing. Worded
