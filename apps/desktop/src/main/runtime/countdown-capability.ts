/**
 * The `countdown` capability — the model-facing half of runtime/countdown.ts.
 *
 * One tool, `countdown_start`: "run THIS tool call N seconds after my reply
 * is finished, on a card the user can abort". It is the generic form of what
 * `system_power` does for a restart: any action whose effect would land on
 * top of the reply that announces it — or that the user should get a last
 * chance to stop — goes through here instead of running inside the turn.
 *
 * Safety is the SAME gate the direct call would face: the armed target is
 * matched against the amygdala's patterns at arm time and, when it needs
 * confirmation, the approval card is raised now (with the target's own
 * description), never at fire time when no turn is alive to route it.
 * A blocked target is refused outright. What fires later is executed
 * without a second gate — the user already answered.
