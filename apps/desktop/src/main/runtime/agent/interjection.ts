/**
 * Mid-turn user messages ("interjections").
 *
 * A message the user sends while a turn is still running used to be parked
 * by every surface — the in-app composer, the terminal, the phone, the
 * Telegram/WhatsApp queues — until the turn ended, then dispatched as its
 * own turn. That was the wrong shape: the user is steering the work that is
 * happening NOW ("skip the tests folder", "actually use the other file"),
 * and a message that only lands after the run finishes steers nothing.
 *
 * The TurnRunner keeps a per-conversation inbox; the agent loop drains it at
 * exactly two stop points (see Agent.runRespond → deliverInterjections):
 *
 *  1. the top of every iteration, before the next model call — this covers
 *     a message that arrived during the previous tool batch AND one that
 *     arrived before the very first call;
 *  2. the branch where the model produced no tool calls and the turn would
 *     otherwise end — the turn stays alive and the model answers the new
 *     message instead of the surface starting a fresh turn.
 *
 * Never inside a tool batch: every tool_use id the model emitted must be
 * answered in the immediately following user turn, so a batch always runs to
 * completion before a message is read. A delivered message is a REAL
 * `role: 'user'` entry in the model's messages (merged into the same user
 * turn as the batch's tool results on Anthropic-shaped wires) and a
 * `user_message` segment in the transcript — so it persists, replays into
 * the next turn's history, mirrors to the other surfaces and exports, all
 * through the paths that already exist.
 *
 * This module is runtime-side on purpose: the channel layer imports the type
 * from here, never the other way round (runtime must not depend on channels).
