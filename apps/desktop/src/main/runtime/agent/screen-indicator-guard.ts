/**
 * The computer-use screen indicator — the blue edge glow plus the centered
 * "Wolffish is capturing your screen" pill — is raised and lowered by the
 * model alone: `computer_glow_on` before the first capture,
 * `computer_glow_off` as the last action of the session. Nothing shows it
 * for the model and nothing hides it while a session is alive.
 *
 * That lifecycle is deliberate, but one half of it is a claim made on the
 * user's own screen rather than a piece of agent state: while the indicator
 * is up, the user is being told they are being watched. The moment the turn
 * ends, that claim is simply false — and it stays on screen forever, because
 * there is no idle timer. Observed live: a computer-use task finished
 * cleanly, the model wrote its summary, and the pill stayed up.
 *
 * So the indicator gets three layers, weakest first, each one only firing
 * where the previous could not:
 *
 *   1. NOTICE   While the indicator is up, SCREEN_INDICATOR_NOTICE rides the
 *               runtime tail on every iteration — the same observe-and-notify
 *               vehicle as the phone/voice reminders, after every cache
 *               breakpoint. Prevention: the rule is restated at the request's
 *               most salient position, where a turn that went well cannot
 *               lose it to a 25k-token prompt.
 *   2. NUDGE    A turn may not END with an indicator it raised. When the
 *               model stops calling tools while the glow is up,
 *               screenIndicatorNudge injects a system aside and the loop runs
 *               again, so the model closes it itself — model-led, just later
 *               than it should have been. Bounded by
 *               MAX_SCREEN_INDICATOR_NUDGES so it can never spin.
 *   3. FAILSAFE The Agent's finally clears it when the turn is over for real
 *               and no model step can happen any more (cancel, error, or a
 *               spent nudge budget). Not an idle timer and never mid-session:
 *               it is the harness refusing to leave a false statement on a
 *               user's screen after the agent that made it has stopped
 *               running.
 *
 * The counterpart on the other end lives in the plugin: the capture and input
 * tools refuse to run until the indicator is up (or has proved unavailable),
 * so "watched without the signal" is impossible rather than merely forbidden.
