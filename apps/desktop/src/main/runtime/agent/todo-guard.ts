/**
 * The model's task list (`todo_write`) is rendered as a checklist card on
 * every surface — the app, the phone, the terminal — and the user reads it as
 * the progress bar for the work. It is model-maintained by design: only a
 * `todo_write` moves an item, nothing infers completion from a tool result or
 * from the turn ending.
 *
 * That leaves one failure the doctrine alone did not prevent, observed live:
 * the model writes the list once at the start, does all the work, writes a
 * wrap-up that says "done" — and the card under it still says
 * `in_progress`. Every surface then shows a finished task as unfinished,
 * forever, because no later turn owns that list.
 *
 * Same three-layer shape as screen-indicator-guard, weakest first:
 *
 *   1. NOTICE   From the first `todo_write` of the turn until the list has
 *               no open item, TASK-LIST notice rides the runtime tail on
 *               every iteration: what the card currently shows, and the one
 *               rule (write completions as they land, close the list before
 *               the final reply). Prevention, at the request's most salient
 *               position.
 *   2. NUDGE    A turn may not END with a list it wrote this turn still
 *               showing open items. When the model stops calling tools while
 *               items are open, todoCloseoutNudge injects a system aside and
 *               the loop runs once more, so the model writes the true final
 *               state itself — completed, cancelled, or (genuinely blocked)
 *               in_progress with a follow-up. Bounded by MAX_TODO_NUDGES.
 *
 * There is deliberately no failsafe: the runtime cannot know whether an item
 * finished, and guessing would put a lie on the card. A list a nudged model
 * still leaves open is the model's statement that the work is not done.
 *
 * The aside REPORTS and never prescribes, which it did not always do. Until
 * 2026-09-18 it ordered the model to close the list "then end with an entirely
 * empty response — zero characters", and that order manufactured the exact
 * failure control-token-guard exists to catch: a heartbeat run on
 * deepseek-flash closed its list, was told to say nothing, could not emit a
 * zero-token content channel, and typed the Chinese set phrase for "utterly
 * empty" instead — four characters, four output tokens, delivered to the user
 * as the last word of the run. Demanding silence from a model that cannot
 * produce it buys a placeholder every time.
 *
 * So the aside now hands over the two facts the model cannot see for itself —
 * its last reply is already delivered and unrecallable, and the card renders
 * BELOW that reply — and leaves the ending where it belongs. The conversation
 * is the model's: it decides whether the user still needs a closing line or
 * whether the turn is genuinely finished. The single invariant kept from the
 * old copy is the one that is not a matter of taste: a typed stand-in for
 * silence, in any script, is a message and not an ending.
 *
 * Lists inherited from an earlier turn are a different case (see
 * openTodoNotice in Agent.ts): the runtime tells the model about them, but a
 * turn doing unrelated work is free to leave them alone.
