/**
 * The closing-message contract: a turn that already wrote its wrap-up and closed
 * it with a turn-closing tool must not tell the user the same news twice.
 *
 * Observed live — conversation `2026-09-19_23-33-18_452-d73f7b`, turn 3: the
 * model wrote a full closing answer, called `notify_phone`, then wrote the same
 * answer again, reworded, in the iteration that tool call opened. Two closing
 * paragraphs, one screen.
 *
 * The fix is copy-led (the prompt and the tool description, which is the binding
 * site), with this guard as the residual: one advisory line on the runtime tail,
 * into a model call that was already happening. No suppression, no extra request.
 *
 * Run: TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH=tsconfig.node.json npx tsx src/main/runtime/__tests__/closing-guard.test.ts
