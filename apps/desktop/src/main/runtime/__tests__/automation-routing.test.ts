/**
 * Automations are managed by tools, never by hand — the invariant is the
 * OPERATION, not the file. The prompt has to carry it in three places at once,
 * because the failure it prevents is silent: a job written straight into
 * heartbeat.md skips schedule validation, the live scheduler reload, the
 * per-job setting markers and the edit stamps, so the Automations page and the
 * running scheduler disagree with the file until the next writer overwrites it.
 *
 * Two rules are pinned here beyond the copy:
 *
 *  1. heartbeat.md stays an ordinary file. The rule is about automation
 *     OPERATIONS, not about forbidding writes to a path — a copy edit that
 *     turns it back into a blanket ban is its own bug, and this asserts the
 *     carve-out survives.
 *  2. (App only) the bundled capability declares a `version`; in the cloud the
 *     registry versions capabilities by package hash, so there is none here. Capability
 *     sync to an existing install is version-gated (migrateOfficialCapabilities
 *     skips a null version), so dropping it makes every edit below inert on
 *     every machine that already ran the app — which is exactly how a fully
 *     corrected prompt ships to nobody.
 *
 * Run: TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH=tsconfig.node.json npx tsx src/main/runtime/__tests__/automation-routing.test.ts
