/**
 * The in-app display switches' defaults and upgrade path, plus the run pool's
 * family classifier.
 *
 * What is checked here is the part that fails silently. A default that read as
 * `undefined` instead of its real value would still coerce today and flip the
 * moment someone wrote `?? true` somewhere; a setter that rebuilt its config
 * section would quietly reset the neighbouring switch; and the family
 * classifier is what the Automations pages on both devices use to skip
 * procedure runs when gating their play buttons — get it wrong and a heading
 * lights up as running for somebody else's job.
 *
 * Standalone — no vitest/jest in this repo. Run:
 *   npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.node.json src/main/runtime/__tests__/inapp-config-defaults.test.ts
