/**
 * Every published capability's SKILL.md (capabilities/ at the repo root) must parse, and parse to its own
 * folder name. A frontmatter that js-yaml rejects (the 2026-09-21 case: an
 * unquoted `description:` scalar that grew a ": " inside it) makes the
 * cerebellum register the folder under its dot-name with status "error" —
 * the capability silently vanishes from the index and every one of its
 * tools becomes "unknown tool". That is how shell_exec disappeared on a
 * machine that had the shell capability installed.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx src/main/runtime/__tests__/bundled-skills.test.ts
