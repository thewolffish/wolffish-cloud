/**
 * An AppImage does not run from where it lives.
 *
 * The runtime mounts the image at a fresh `/tmp/.mount_WolffiXXXXXX` for the
 * lifetime of the process and unmounts it on exit, so `app.getPath('exe')` and
 * `process.resourcesPath` both point INSIDE a directory that is gone the moment
 * the app closes — and that has a different name next time. Anything this app
 * writes for later therefore recorded a path that could never work again: the
 * CLI shim (`wolffish: No such file or directory` from the first day), the
 * systemd unit, the XDG autostart entry. Each of those is written once and read
 * by something else much later, which is exactly the worst case for a path that
 * expires; the app itself never noticed, because within a single run the mount
 * is real.
 *
 * The runtime exports `APPIMAGE` holding the path of the .AppImage FILE, which
 * is the stable handle to the same app. electron-updater already depends on it
 * to find the file it replaces on update, so it is as load-bearing as it looks.
 *
 * Everything here is a no-op off the AppImage path: a .deb, .rpm, .dmg or NSIS
 * install unpacks to a real directory and needs none of it.

 * replacement is unknowable from outside (the mount name is random per run, so
 * no fixed string can name it). The client is 400 KB of plain ESM importing
 * nothing but node builtins, so the honest fix is to lift it out of the image
 * and keep a copy under ~/.wolffish, where `rm -rf ~/.wolffish` still ends it.
 *
 * Re-copied on every boot rather than once: an AppImage self-updates in place,
 * and a CLI a version behind its daemon is a bug report nobody can reproduce.
 * Overwrite-in-place, never delete-then-copy — a `wolffish` starting up during
 * the gap would import half a client.
 *
 * Best-effort. If the copy fails the caller gets the in-mount path back, which
 * is no worse than what shipped before this existed.
