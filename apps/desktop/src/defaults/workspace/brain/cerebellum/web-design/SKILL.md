# Web Design

A core capability. Its one tool, `web_design`, returns the web design manual: the
treatment-calibration and section-map planning steps, the rail-and-column page
architecture, dual light/dark theme tokens (system preference plus toggle override),
type voices built from system font stacks, the component kit (cover plate, index
rail, notes, figure plates, hairline tables, pills, card grids, Q&A, steps,
checklists), hand-drawn SVG figure rules, the JS-as-enhancement doctrine (pages must
read complete with scripts off), RTL/Arabic rules, and the mandatory
`browser_screenshot` + `image_view` verify loop.

The manual itself lives in `manual.md` beside this file; the plugin reads and returns
it. The core contract (`agents.core.md`) tells you to call `web_design` before
authoring any web page — this capability is what delivers it. Explicit user or
automation design instructions always take precedence over the manual. Documents
meant to print or ship as a PDF are `pdf_design`'s job, not this capability's.
