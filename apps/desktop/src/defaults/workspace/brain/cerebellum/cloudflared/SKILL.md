# Cloudflared

## Usage

Use `cloudflared_check` to verify cloudflared is installed. If missing,
call `cloudflared_install` (requires user approval) — it's managed-first and
needs no admin rights: it reuses a global cloudflared if present, else downloads
the official no-root binary into `~/.wolffish/bin/cloudflared`. Only use
`cloudflared_install_system` if the user explicitly wants a global install.

Use `cloudflared_tunnel` with a local port number to create a quick tunnel.
This starts cloudflared in the background and returns a public URL like
`https://random-name.trycloudflare.com` that routes to `localhost:{port}`.

## Rules

- Always confirm with the user before exposing a local service to the internet.
- The tunnel runs in the background. Save the PID from the response to stop it later.
- Quick tunnels use random subdomains and don't require a Cloudflare account.
