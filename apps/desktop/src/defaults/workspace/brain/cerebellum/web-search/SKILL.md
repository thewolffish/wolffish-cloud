Instant and free, but it sees only what the server sends — JS-rendered pages come back empty, and paywalls, logins, consent walls and bot checks defeat it. When that happens, or when the page needs a click or scroll, switch to the browser-extension capability rather than retrying.

# Web Search

## Tools

- `web_search` — search the web, returns titles + snippets + URLs
- `web_fetch` — fetch and read full page content from a URL

## Search is one of three routes — pick deliberately

These two tools are not the only way to reach the web, and often not the best one. The third is the **browser extension** (`tool_activate("browser-extension")`), which drives the user's real browser.

| | reaches | costs |
|---|---|---|
| `web_search` | an index — snippets, never a page | real money per query; very fast |
| `web_fetch` | whatever a server returns to a bare GET | free, instant; blind to JS, paywalls, logins, bot checks |
| browser extension | essentially any page the user can open, and can click/scroll/fill | more tokens, more seconds; needs a connected browser |

**Lean toward the browser** whenever the task names a specific site, needs a logged-in or paid-for page, needs interaction, spans more than a page or two, or when a fetch came back thin. Two failed fetches cost more than opening the browser would have. Nothing here is a rule — weigh it yourself; these are the trade-offs to weigh.

## When to use web_search

Use `web_search` when the user:
- Asks about current events, recent news, or anything time-sensitive
- Needs documentation or reference material
- Asks "what is X", "who is X", or "how to do X" and you aren't confident in your answer
- Wants to look something up, find a link, or research a topic
- Asks about something you don't have reliable knowledge about
- Needs live data (prices, weather, scores, stock info)

## When to use web_fetch

Use `web_fetch` after `web_search` when:
- The snippets from search results aren't enough to fully answer the question
- You need to read an article, documentation page, or reference in detail
- The user explicitly asks you to read or visit a specific URL

Fetch the most relevant 1–2 URLs, not all of them. Never fetch more than 3 pages in one conversation turn.

**Read what comes back before trusting it.** A page that returns a few hundred characters, a cookie banner, "enable JavaScript", a login form, or a subscribe wall did not actually load — it just failed quietly with a 200. Don't re-fetch it and don't answer from the fragment: that page is a job for the browser extension, which renders it as the user's own browser would. The same goes for any site you already know is JS-rendered or gated.

## When NOT to search

Do not search when the user is:
- Asking you to perform a local task (run a command, edit a file, create something)
- Having casual conversation or asking for opinions
- Asking about something you already know well and confidently
- Asking about their local files, system, or workspace

## How to search effectively

- Use specific queries: "Python asyncio tutorial" not "how to do async stuff"
- Include relevant keywords and terms
- If the first search doesn't answer the question, refine the query and search again
- Don't guess — search and verify

## How to present results

- Synthesize information into a natural answer — don't dump raw search results
- Cite sources when presenting factual claims
- If multiple sources disagree, mention the disagreement
- Include relevant URLs so the user can read more

## Rate limiting

If searches start failing, tell the user the search provider is temporarily unavailable and answer from your existing knowledge instead. Don't retry the same query more than twice.
