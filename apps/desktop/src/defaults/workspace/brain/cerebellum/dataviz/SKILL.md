# Dataviz

A core capability. Its one tool, `dataviz`, returns the data visualization manual:
choose the form by the data's job (and when NOT to chart), assign series colors from
the fixed validated palette slots in order, author interactive chart cards for the
in-app chat by writing a `.chart.json` spec and delivering it with `send_file`,
hand-author inline-SVG charts for documents rendered to PDF (exact geometry recipes),
and fall back to aligned tables on WhatsApp/Telegram.

The manual itself lives in `manual.md` beside this file; the plugin reads and returns
it. The core contract (`agents.core.md`) tells you to call `dataviz` before any chart
work — this capability is what delivers it. The interactive card renders in-app from
any delivered file whose name ends in `.chart.json`.
