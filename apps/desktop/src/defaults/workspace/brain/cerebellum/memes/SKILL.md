    description: Insert the most recently generated meme or GIF into the CURRENT chat as an inline image. No arguments needed. Call after meme_generate, gif_search, or gif_trending when the image should appear here. To send it to someone on a channel instead, pass the wolffish-media:// path from the generate result to send_file / whatsapp_send_image — never base64 it.
    parameters: {}
  - name: meme_generate
    description: Generate a captioned meme image from a template. Pass template_id exactly as returned by meme_templates — the id determines the provider on its own. Returns a wolffish-media:// path to the saved image.

      template_id:
        type: string

# Memes

## When to meme

**Proactively (sparingly):** If the user seems frustrated, stressed, or the conversation naturally calls for humor — include a relevant meme. Once per conversation at most unless the user asks for more.

**On request:** When the user explicitly asks for a meme, says "send me a meme", "make a meme about X", "I need a laugh", "cheer me up", etc.

**When NOT to meme:** Don't send memes during genuinely serious issues, focused deep-work sessions, or when the tone is clearly not playful.

## Picking a provider

- **Giphy** — **preferred first choice.** If a Giphy API key is configured, search for a relevant GIF before generating a captioned meme. Giphy results are fast, expressive, and usually land better than generated text memes. Use `gif_search` with a descriptive query matching the mood or topic.
- **memegen.link** — fallback for captioned memes. Use when Giphy has no good match, the user explicitly asks for a captioned/template meme, or no Giphy API key is configured.
- **Imgflip** — only if the user has configured credentials AND specifically asks for it. Its library is just ~100 popular templates with no real search, so `meme_templates` with `provider: imgflip` often comes back empty — drop the provider to search memegen instead.

**One rule that prevents wasted calls: never mix provider and id.** The id from `meme_templates` already carries its provider (slug = memegen, all-numeric = Imgflip). Pass that id straight to `meme_generate` and leave `provider` off — `meme_generate` routes by the id. Don't take a memegen slug like `db` and call it with `provider: imgflip`; that combination is what used to fail.

## Caption guidelines

- Keep captions short and punchy.
- Match the meme format's conventions (e.g. Drake: top = bad thing, bottom = good thing).
- Make it specific to the conversation context — generic memes aren't as funny.
- For multi-box templates, each element in `lines` maps to a box in order.

## Delivering the image

Where the image should land decides how you deliver it:

**Into the current chat** — call `add_to_chat()` after generating or finding an image. It takes no arguments and automatically injects whatever was just generated.

Workflow:
1. If Giphy is configured, try `gif_search` first with a descriptive query. Fall back to `meme_generate` only if no good result or if a captioned meme is specifically needed.
2. Call `add_to_chat()` — no arguments needed
3. Add a short comment in your text response

Do **not** copy the markdown URL into your prose — `add_to_chat` handles delivery automatically.

**To someone on a channel** (e.g. "send this meme to my wife on WhatsApp") — do NOT use `add_to_chat` (that only posts to the current chat). Take the `wolffish-media://…` path from the `meme_generate` / `gif_search` result and pass it as the `path` to the channel's send tool — `whatsapp_send_image`, `telegram_send_photo`, or `send_file`. Those tools read the file off disk themselves. **Never** `base64`-encode the image to send it: that floods the context and hangs the turn. The path is all you need.
