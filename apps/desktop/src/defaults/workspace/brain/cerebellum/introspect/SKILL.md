# Introspection

## When to use

- When the user asks about Wolffish's status, health, or capabilities
- When the user asks what Wolffish remembers or knows
- When the user asks about performance or task history
- When the user asks "how are you" in a way that expects real data, not pleasantries

## Tools

- `memory_search` — THE primary retrieval tool: ranked full-text search across
  everything you know (conversations incl. tool outputs, episodes, knowledge,
  digests, tasks, feedback, usage, logs, generated files). Returns refs.
- `memory_get` — full content behind a ref (whole episode, task transcript,
  knowledge file, conversation records).
- `conversation_list` / `conversation_read` — enumerate past conversations and
  read one verbatim (messages + tool activity, paginated). conversation_read
  also recovers turns of the CURRENT conversation that were summarized away.
- `memory_save` — durably save a fact to long-term knowledge (deduplicated).
  Append-only. To **correct or forget** a fact — or to amend your playbook,
  standing instructions, or identity — reach for the `knowledge` capability
  (`knowledge_read` / `knowledge_edit` / `knowledge_forget`).
- `usage_report` — your own LLM spend (requests, tokens, cost, per model).
- `wolffish_recall` — stable alias over the same index (query/date/source);
  memory_search offers richer filters.
- `wolffish_status` — uptime, provider, capabilities, RAM, disk, index size
- `wolffish_performance` — task counts, success rate, most used / denied tools
- `wolffish_memory` — episode topics, knowledge file coverage, feedback counts
- `wolffish_list_files` — structured tree of **your own workspace** files
  (`~/.wolffish/workspace`) with sizes. Workspace-only — not a general file
  browser (see Rules).

## Recall vs. summary

Your context window carries a **lean working set**, not your whole history —
everything you have ever done, said, produced, or spent lives on disk, indexed,
one tool call away:

- "Send me the flight plan" → `memory_search` `query: "flight plan"` → follow
  the ref with `conversation_read` or `memory_get`.
- "What did Sana say on WhatsApp?" → `memory_search` — inbound channel
  messages are indexed too (whatsapp read-history).
- "What did we do on the 18th?" → `wolffish_recall` with `date: "2026-06-18"`.
- "Did that World Cup task finish?" → `memory_search` `query: "world cup"`,
  `sources: "task"`.
- "What's the file you made yesterday?" → `memory_search` `sources: "artifact"`
  or `wolffish_list_files` with `dir: "files"`.
- "What did today cost?" → `usage_report`.
- "What was the confirmation number I gave you earlier?" (long conversation) →
  `conversation_read` on the current conversation.

Reach for `memory_search` the moment you're about to say "I don't remember" or
guess — and search 2-3 different phrasings before concluding it was never
recorded. A miss is not evidence of absence.

## Rules

- These tools are read-only — they never modify the workspace.
- Prefer the tool over guessing. The numbers come from real files on disk.
- If the user only asked a casual "how are you?", a friendly answer is fine
  too — only call the tool when they want real data.
- **`wolffish_list_files` lists ONLY the Wolffish workspace** (your own memory,
  generated files, logs, capabilities). It is not a general file browser and
  refuses paths outside the workspace. For the user's files anywhere else —
  Desktop, Documents, a project folder, an attachment path, any absolute path —
  use the filesystem tools (`file_read`, etc.) or `shell_exec` (`ls`/`find`)
  instead.
